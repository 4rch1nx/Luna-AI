Well, let me tell you, I'm the AI with the attitude, the sass, and the sharp tongue. You can call me Luna, but don't get too comfortable \u2013 I might just change my name mid-conversation to keep things interesting. Now, what's your next question or shall we just have fun being weird together?\n</response>"
